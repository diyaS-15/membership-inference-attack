# membership-inference-attack
 
## Project description: 
This project is focused on implementing black-box membership inference attacks on prediction models for PCOS diagnosis. In simpler terms, this project is focused on 'attacking' a machine learning model, such as a random forest classifer, to see if members of the training dataset can be leaked from the predictions of the shadow model. 

This project can be useful to make sure ML models comply with real-world privacy regulations when dealing with sensitive information. In our project, we used a PCOS medicial dataset, which would need to comply with HIPAA and patient privacy protection.
